Game of Life

**Summary**

Players can make templates of cell layouts using O's and X's to define alive and dead cells. These templates are used placed on a game board (size defined by user) and for each second that passes the cells to continue to live, die or are reborn based on rules relating to their proximity to other live and dead cells. The game continues until the user presses a key.

**Tests**

In-built test classes can be run to test the capacity of the program to apply the rules of the game, which conform to those defined in Conway's Game of Life.
